                        <h3>Ruby Slippers</h3>
                        <p>Because of their iconic stature,[99] the ruby slippers worn by Judy Garland in the film are now among
                            the most treasured and valuable film memorabilia in movie history.[100] The silver slippers that
                            Dorothy wore in the book series were changed to ruby to take advantage of the new Technicolor
                            process. Adrian, MGM's chief costume designer, was responsible for the final design. A number
                            of pairs were made, though no one knows exactly how many.
                            <p>After filming, the slippers were stored among the studio's extensive collection of costumes and
                                faded from attention. They were found in the basement of MGM's wardrobe department during
                                preparations for a mammoth auction in 1970. One pair was the highlight of the auction, going
                                for a then unheard of $15,000 to an anonymous buyer, who apparently donated them to the Smithsonian
                                Institution in 1979. Four other pairs are known to exist; one sold for $666,000 at auction
                                in 2000. A pair was stolen from the Judy Garland Museum in Grand Rapids, Minnesota and remains
                                missing.[101]</p>
                            <p>Another, differently styled pair not used in the film was sold at auction with the rest of her
                                collections by owner actress Debbie Reynolds for $510,000 (not including the buyer's premium)
                                in June 2011.[102]</p>
